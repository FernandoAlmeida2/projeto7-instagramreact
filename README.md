# Project 07: Instagram [React]


## About The Project
<p align="center">This project is a much simpler version of Instagram, using **React. It's a project for a bootcamp training, so the purpose is exclusively for learning and gaining experience. The parts with new content to me was the functional components, and the useState interaction with the user, both concepts of **React. It was an initial but exciting experience that gave a taste of what comes next.</p>
